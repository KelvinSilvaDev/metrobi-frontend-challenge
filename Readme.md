This repository contains a React app built with TypeScript that aims to solve and display all the answers to the following questions as part of the application process for a Frontend Developer position at Metrobi. The questions are:

1.  Write a JavaScript function that finds the duplicate items in any given array.
2.  Write an async JavaScript function that writes every item in any given array with 1, 2, 4, 8, ... seconds apart. For example, for ["a","b", "c", "d"], "a" is printed in 1 sec, "b" is printed in 2 seconds, "c" is printed in 4 seconds, ...
3.  Write the necessary React code for generating the below figure (using flex).

4.  Write an efficient method that tells us whether or not an input string brackets ("{", "}", "(", ")", "[", "]") opened and closed properly. Example: "{[]}" => true, "{(])}" => false, "{([)]}" => false
5.  A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking. If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped from that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again. Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking, with as few drops as possible in the worst-case scenario.
6.  Write the code that animates "Zeno's Paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise" on an interface (we would like to see the paradox demonstrated).
7.  Think that you have an unlimited number of carrots, but a limited number of carrot types. Also, you have one bag that can hold a limited weight. Each type of carrot has a weight and a price. Write a function that takes carrotTypes and capacity and returns the maximum value the bag can hold. [Python or JavaScript]

The app is deployed on Vercel, and you can access it at [https://metrobi-dev-frontend-challenge.vercel.app/](https://metrobi-dev-frontend-challenge.vercel.app/). To run the app locally, clone the repository and run the following commands:
